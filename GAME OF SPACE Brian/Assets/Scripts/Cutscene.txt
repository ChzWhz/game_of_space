The year is 3491. Humanity is on the brink of extinction.
After years of colonizing space...
...exploiting alien civilizations...
...and bullying the intergalactic council...
the four oldest races in the universe are ready
to deliver humanity its death knell.
Earth's military is weakened and spread
thin across the galaxy. Economic inequality
has led to tumultuous uprisings in the few
remaining systems under Earth's control.
Without allies to lend military might,
or pressure the galaxy into a peaceful
solution, humanity will be annihilated
in the wars to come. You have been
tasked by the U.N. to serve as
envoy to the galactic council in
these times of strife. The N.I.I. has prepared
briefings on your fellow ambassadors,
identifying pressure points and singling
out those amenable to extortion.
Your mission is simple:
Save humanity through any means necessary.
