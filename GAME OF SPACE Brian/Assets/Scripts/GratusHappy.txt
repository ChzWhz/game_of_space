It’s good to see you again, Ambassador.
Thanks for the cab from the airport.
I was worried public transport might
not be the safest option these days…
How are you holding up?

Gratus
Ambassador Reev briefed me on the state
of play. The High Council of Endora
has pledged military support to humanity.
Have you talked to Ambassador Nevris?

Gratus
I see…for the best, probably. He brought
two of his concubines to meet Ambassador
Calin last week. Poor tact, if you ask me.
But I wouldn’t expect anything less of
an Uuma Minister.

Gratus
Yes. Calin was rather put off by the whole
thing. For a religious species, the Uuma 
do seem prone to fits of testosterone.
Watching Nevris try to sway the council
is like watching one of your pet dogs try
to fuck an armchair. Needless to say,
with Nevris self-sabotaging, humanity’s
future should be in good hands. I’ll be
back soon, and we’ll see where
everything lies.

I just came from lunch. Ambassador Nevris
and I ate at one of your restaurants,
"Sal Louie's Pizzeria." The one two
sublevels below Xanda Memorial Park.
Apparently, he was unfamiliar with 
your custom of a gratuity, and our
waiter ended up on worker's comp at
the end of the meal. Did you find
time to speak with Ambassador Calin?
